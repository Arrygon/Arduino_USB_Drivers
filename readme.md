#Instructions
###Here we have the signed and unsigned drivers for the CH341 and CH340 usb controller drivers. These drivers are commonly found on Chinese Arduino micro-controllers. 

##This repo contains the drivers for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android

#Note: 
###Used the signed drivers unless you have a particular reason for using the unsigned ones. Unsigned drivers require you to remove driver signature enforcement on Windows and Mac.
